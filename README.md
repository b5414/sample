-   `npm i` to install pkgs, then `npm run start`, then add the `/dist` folder as chrome extension at `chrome://extensions/` url with dev mode enabled;

-   `npm run start` to see the issue (in console of oppened google tab (with S icon on win), after you install/reshresh the chrome extension from dist)

-   `npm run build` to see the solved issue
